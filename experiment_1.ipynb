This can be done using various algorithms and techniques, such as morphological analysis or statistical modeling. In natural language processing, lemmatization is often used to normalize text data by converting words to their root forms, which can help improve the accuracy of downstream tasks like information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Lemmatization can also be useful for reducing the dimensionality of word embeddings or for improving the performance of language models.\n",
