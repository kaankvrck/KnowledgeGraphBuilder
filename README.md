# Project Title: Comparative Analysis of Manual Knowledge Graphs and LLM Based Knowledge Graphs

## Project Description
This project aims to compare manually created knowledge graphs with those automatically generated by Ollama Gemma 7B, a large language model (LLM). The comparison seeks to highlight the differences and similarities between manually curated knowledge graphs and those created by an LLM, providing valuable insights for knowledge graph generation.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.9.16. All dependencies can be installed via the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation Instructions
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # MacOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Project Usage
1. Download and set up the Ollama Gemma 7B model, following the official Ollama documentation. More details can be found [here](https://ollama.com/).

2. Run the analysis to compare automatically generated knowledge graphs with manually created ones.

## Academic Relevance
This project provides an empirical framework for analyzing the efficiency and accuracy of automated knowledge graph generation using large language models. The comparison may offer new insights into how machine-generated graphs can complement or improve existing manual methodologies.
